## RepresentativeTreeViz

This prototype "clusters" the output of an infection map into trees of similar epidemic structure based on the R_t tree distance. A representative tree is chosen for the "clusters" and is used as a basis for a web-based visualization. A post-hoc policy simulation is performed to determine how different policies affect a given InfectionMap.

### Code Overview and Technology

Java is used to preprocess the data with a CPLEX library to calculate the Tree Edit Distance and JUNIT for unit test.
The visualization using Javascript with d3 and requirejs.

To run the Java project and generate the trees, use the main method supplied in DataToJsonTree.java in GraphVisualization/RepresentativeTreeCalculator/ . Specify the inputfolder location and ensure that it has the following files:

infectionMap.txt
events.csv
contacts_pop_XXXX.csv
people_pop_XXXX.csv

These files are generated by the simulation output of https://github.com/ScottishCovidResponse/Contact-Tracing-Model
Example output files from a simulation run are supplied in RepresentativeTreeCalculator/Data/SimulationData

The resulting output files from the Java program can be copied to ContactSimulationViz/data which will need to be hosted on a (local) webserver to be visualized. 
An example version (not always the latest) is available at http://cs.swansea.ac.uk/ContactViz/ContactSimulationViz/


RepresentativeTreeCalculator/ contains the Java code to generate the representative trees
JsonMerge/ contains a small subproject to merge Json files of the output of the RepresentativeTreeCalculator/ when the user decides to not calculate all data in one go.
ContactSimulationViz/ contains the code to visualize the generated representative trees


### Example screenshots

Here is a screenshot from the prototype from 07/06/2021 where the resulting representative trees are visualized and a post-hoc policy on the trace of an infection map is visualized:
